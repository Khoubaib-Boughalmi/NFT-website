  - **React** - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **React Router DOM** - Used for routing and navigation within the React application.
  - **Styled Components** - A CSS-in-JS library for writing styled components with ease.

  - **Fontsource** - Included fonts like "Akaya Telivigala" and "Sora" to enhance the visual presentation.

- **Testing:**
  - **Jest** - A popular testing framework for JavaScript applications.
  - **React Testing Library** - Used for testing React components and user interactions.

## Getting Started

To run the NFT Website locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

2. Start the development server with the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

This will launch the NFT Website in your preferred web browser, allowing you to interact with the application and explore its features.

## Conclusion

Building the NFT Website from scratch was an enriching experience that allowed me to explore and learn various front-end technologies. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with React, React Router, styled components, animation libraries like GSAP, and testing with Jest and React Testing Library.

I'm proud of the results achieved in this project, and I'm excited to continue leveraging the knowledge and skills I acquired during its development. The NFT Website serves as a testament to my growth as a developer and showcases my ability to create visually appealing and interactive web applications.
