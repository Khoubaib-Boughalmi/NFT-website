## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** NFT Website
- **Objective:** Building a website for showcasing and trading Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

## Technology Stack

During the development of the NFT Website, I used the following technologies and dependencies:

- **Front-end:**

  - **React** - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **React Router DOM** - Used for routing and navigation within the React application.
  - **Styled Components** - A CSS-in-JS library for writing styled components with ease.
  - **Swiper** - A powerful and flexible touch slider library for creating interactive carousels and sliders.
  - **Typewriter Effect** - An animated typing effect library used to create engaging text animations.
  - **React Confetti** - A library for adding confetti effects to celebrate special events or achievements.
  - **GSAP** - GreenSock Animation Platform for creating smooth animations and transitions.
  - **Normalize.css** - A modern alternative to CSS resets, ensuring consistent styling across different browsers.
  - **Web Vitals** - A library for measuring and tracking web performance metrics.
  - **Fontsource** - Included fonts like "Akaya Telivigala" and "Sora" to enhance the visual presentation.

Building the NFT Website from scratch was an enriching experience that allowed me to explore and learn various front-end technologies. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with React, React Router, styled components, animation libraries like GSAP, and testing with Jest and React Testing Library.

I'm proud of the results achieved in this project, and I'm excited to continue leveraging the knowledge and skills I acquired during its development. The NFT Website serves as a testament to my growth as a developer and showcases my ability to create visually appealing and interactive web applications.
